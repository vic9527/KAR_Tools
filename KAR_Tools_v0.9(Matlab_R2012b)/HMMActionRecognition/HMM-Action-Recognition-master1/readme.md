Action recognition using skeleton information based on HMM
==========================================================
 
This code is developed for a project: action recognition using HMM.

Dataset: [MSR Action3D dataset](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/zliu/ActionRecoRsrc/)

This project is trying to use the skeleton information as features and HMM as the model:
* skeleton information
* HMM model

Future work will be done in:
* combine skeleton information with 3DMTM as the features
* realtime application
